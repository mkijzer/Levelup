Start by auditing your last 30 days of expenses. Find one thing you can kill today. It’s not about deprivation; it’s about control.</p><p>Next, automate your savings. Set up a system to auto-invest 15% of your income into a low-risk index fund. Compound interest isn’t sexy, but it works. If you’re not making more than you spend, you’re losing.
